# CHANGELOG
All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

<!-- TODO: chose format for commits and add library for generate changelog file -->
<!-- check https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog -->

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com).

It is generated from the `git` commits whose message starts with
`added:` / `changed:` / `deprecated:` / `removed:` / `fixed:` / `security:`
thanks to [gitchangelog](https://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog) :
`pip install gitchangelog pystache`
`gitchangelog`

You can still use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), starting for example with
`chore:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` / `style:` / `test:`, they just won't be included in this changelog.

<!-- gitchangelog START -->

<!-- gitchangelog END -->
